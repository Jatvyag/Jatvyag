## About
I’m a developer and data professional with a strong legal foundation. My academic background (PhD in Law, MPA) focused on Data Protection and Digital Government, giving me a unique perspective on governance, compliance, and privacy in data-driven systems.

Today, I work across the data stack: designing and engineering pipelines, analyzing data with Python, and developing interactive BI dashboards using JavaScript, Vue (with Pinia & Vite), DevExtreme, and Highcharts. I have experience with a range of SQL databases including PostgreSQL, SQLite, DuckDB, and ClickHouse.

I’m passionate about leveraging data to drive insights and build intuitive interfaces, especially in domains related to data analytics, and data engineering.
